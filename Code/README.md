The Fortran files can be compilated into a executable file **src.exe** using the command line :  
> `gfortan definitions.f90 fonctions.f90 lecture_ecriture.f90 main_3Dtissue.f90 -o src.exe`

To operate, the executable requires the presence in the same folder of the file **PARAMETERS.txt** which contains the working parameters of the model.
